# Formalization

The formalization consists of the following files:

- Permutation.thy formalizes permutations and their properties

- Coloring.thy formalizes graph colorings and their properties

- ColoredGraph.thy formalizes colored graphs and their properties

- GraphIsomorphism.thy formalizes the concept of graph isomorphism,
  automorphism groups and their properties

- McKayPiperno.thy formalizes the McKay/Piperno's abstract scheme for
  canonical labelling, as well as our particular instantiation of such
  scheme

- ProofFormat.thy formalizes our proof system: the facts and their
  semantics, the rules, and the abstract specification of the
  checker. The soundness of the proof system is proven and the
  correctness of the abstract specification of the checker is
  verified.
